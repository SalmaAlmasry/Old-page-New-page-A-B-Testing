# Old-page-New-page-A-B-Testing
### we will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.

The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. The goal is to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

We also use logistic regression to try and predict conversion based on the page or the country the user is in.

### The data can be found [here](https://github.com/SalmaAlmasry/Old-page-New-page-A-B-Testing/blob/main/ab_data.csv) and [here](https://github.com/SalmaAlmasry/Old-page-New-page-A-B-Testing/blob/main/countries.csv)

### The Workbook can be found [here](https://github.com/SalmaAlmasry/Old-page-New-page-A-B-Testing/blob/main/Analyze_ab_test_results_notebook.ipynb), it contains: 
  - Part I - Probability
  - Part II - A/B Test
  - Part III - A regression approach

### Conclusion 
The general conclusion is that we do not have evidence to say that the new page results in more conversions than the old page or that country have an effect on conversion. also, there is so small difference in conversion rates between the old and new page so there is no practical effect and for my conclusion I suggest we discard the new page as it would be alot of effort and money with no real gain.
